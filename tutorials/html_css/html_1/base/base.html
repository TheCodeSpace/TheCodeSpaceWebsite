<tocm>How does HTML work</tocm>    
<info>HTMl is a tag based language. Indentations (TAB), do not affect how the web page is layed out. HTML can not do any functional stuff, which means once a page is loaded, you cant change anything anymore (unless you use JavaScript).</info>
<info>A basic HTML web page only needs 3 tags. These are <c>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</c>, <c>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</c>, and <c>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</c> which is nested in the body tag as shown below.</info>
<img id="i_crw2" src onerror="integrations('html_css', 'html_1', 'i_crw2').codeRealtime.html('cr_2', true)"></img>
<info>To display text, you can just write your text in between the <c>&lt;html&gt;</c> tags. You can put in your name down here and see your changes. </info>
<img id="i_crw3" src onerror="integrations('html_css', 'html_1', 'i_crw3').codeRealtime.html('cr_3', false)"></img>
<tip>Try to put your date of birth on the next line down.</tip>
<info>You can see that its not that easy. You cant just press enter and have your text on the next line. To accomplish this, use a <c>&lt;br /&gt;</c> or break tag, which you can place </info>
